# PPSC Comp March 2021: Rollercoster Entry
**| difficulty: 4/10 |**

You work at six flags, and a as new rollercoaster called Colossal opened, you were appointed the responsibility of automating the height system for the ride. You are given the minimal height requirement. Any less, and there is a safety risk. As participants enter the line, they'll enter their name and then their height in inches. All you have to do is return a string of the names of people who can ride Colossal, on seperate lines. 

You are given a list of strings, the first name of each individual and then their height (in inches), divided by a space. 

Example: 
height requirement = 64 (inches) 
people = 
"Mark 68
Robert 70
Mary 65
Corey 62"

return
"Mark
Robert
Mary" (since only they meet the height requirement)

**Input**:

integer height requirement (in inches)
list people ("name height")

**Output**:

string people (names of those who meet the requirement, make sure to put newlines between names)
Make sure to add a newline at the end of your answer for it to match the answer format.

This problem deals with for loops, if statements, and lists. Pretty cool. **Do your research, google is your friend.**
